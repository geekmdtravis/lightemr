A light-weight EMR meant to operate on Raspberry Pi. Ultimately the hope is that this program along with Raspberry Pi can offer an inexpensive means for developing countries to benefit from electronic medical records.

**NOTE**: This project was never finished, and there are no real intentions to finish it. I created this project as a resident in internal medicine, very early in my self-study in programming. I didn't have the time or the resources to build out a whole EMR in C while working 75 hours per week, but it was a fun learning experience and taught me to really appreciate how beautiful a language C is.
