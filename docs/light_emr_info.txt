LightEMR: Development Notes
====================================================================
PURPOSE: LightEMR is intended to be an ultra-light-weight EMR
that can be run on devices such as the Raspberry Pi. It is 
intended to be run in developing countries, so HIPAA compliance
and the advanced methods to protect PHI is not a current focus. 
The hope is that for a relatively low overhead and very low 
energy requirements that a local or aid clinician will be able
to utilize this tool to provide faster, more complete care and 
allow for a simple method by which one might collect and utilize
structured data. 

====================================================================

GOALS: 
1. This is going to be completely CLI based
2. No unnecessary pages or keystrokes. 
3. C is the preferred language for simplicity,
   portability, and efficiency. Modules in 
   other languages will be considered, however,
   where appropriate. Python as a 4GL will likely
   have some utility with regard to creating an
   intelligent note-writing tool.
4. Initial focus is for outpatient setting.
5. Modularize the program in such a way that simple
   command lines can also be run directly from a 
   shell prompt to quickly input and retrieve patient
   information. E.g. ./note --find-last --patient-id 
   5555555555. Or ./note --search --patient-id --keyword 
   CHF.

Section A: Topic 1 - Patient Lookup
-----------------------------------
For this section, a clinician should be able to lookup a patient by 
(a) name, (b) dob, (c) person identification number. From this point
a located patient can have basic  clinical documentation input and 
extracted from the EMR. Medical history, prior notes, lab values, 
vital signs, medications are all things that should be associated with
the patient and which a clinician can add or update.
